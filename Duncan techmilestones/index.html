        <h1>This site is a list of important tech-mile stones that have lead us to where we are today</h1>
        <h1>IBM’s personal computer</h1>
            <p>IBM launched its personal computer in August 1981. While IBM’s PC was not the first — others had been available since the 1970s — its version became 
            overly popular and for many it set the standards of what a PC should be. Costing one thousand five hundred sixty five dollors, the IBM 5150 had forty  
            thousand of read-only memory and si of user memory. Other features included a built-in speaker and the the ability to run self-diagnostic checks. 
            It also made use of Microsoft’s MS-DOS 1.0, a 16-bit operating system.</p>
        <h1>The Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation</h1>
            <p>Launched within weeks of each other in 1994, the Sega Saturn and Sony PlayStation consoles blazed a trail in the video gaming industry. While the 
            PlayStation has outlasted the Saturn through multiple iterations, including today’s PlayStation 4, both consoles had a significant impact and 
            influence on home entertainment. Unlike the Super Nintendo, Sega Mega Drive and other similar consoles, games for the Saturn and PlayStation 
            came on CDs rather than cartridges. The consoles had enough power inside to showcase games including the visually stunning “Nights into Dreams” 
            on the Saturn and “Final Fantasy VII,” an in-depth role-playing game on the PlayStation.</p>
        <h1>Connected living</h1>
            <p>Today’s homes are rapidly transforming into spaces where traditional computers dovetail alongside newer pieces of technology, from smartphones 
            and smart TVs to virtual assistants and tablets. With the click of a button, a song being played on a computer in someone’s bedroom can be beamed
            to and displayed on a 72-inch TV in their living room via a high speed, wireless connection. This merging of physical and virtual worlds is known 
            as the internet of things.</p>
        <h1>Well is founded</h1>
            <p>Stewart Brand, publisher of counterculture bible The Whole Earth Catalog, and Larry Brilliant start an Bulletin Board System (BBS) to host what 
            they term an online community. The Well attracts an eclectic mix of intellectuals, computer geeks, hippies, Grateful Dead fans, writers, entrepreneurs, 
            and journalists. Journalists are given free memberships in the early days, leading to many articles about the community and helping it grow.</p>
        <h1>Nintendo releases the NES in the US</h1>
            <p>Since 1983, the American electronic game market had been depressed due to a glut of poorly performing games and consoles. That same year, 
            Nintendo released its Famicom gaming system in Japan. Renamed the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) when it was released in North America, the 
            NES started to reverse the fortunes of the American game industry. The system launched with eighteen available titles, and was largely responsible 
            for turning Mario the Plumber into one of the most enduring characters in the history of video games.</p>
